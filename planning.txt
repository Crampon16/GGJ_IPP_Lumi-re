2D gameplay

A character moves with walls
You can see what is in your light
You have to guide a ray of light to the exit using mirrors

TODO:

- get in touch with Unity (Guillaume, Liam)

BASE
- have a character that moves, with wall collisions
- have a light that lights different areas
- physics of the light ray guided by mirrors
- interaction between player and mirrors
- victory condition
