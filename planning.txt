2D gameplay

A character moves with walls
You can see what is in your light
You have to guide a ray of light to the exit using mirrors

AMBIENCE:
Cave? Building with lights off? Noir movie?


GAME MECHANICS
- flashlight
- mirror and ray

- refractor?
- diffractor?
- HP dependent or time dependent flashlight
- "life crystal"
- "color" mechanics

//TODO:

- get in touch with Unity (Guillaume, Liam)

BASE
- have a character that moves (along x xor y only at the beginning), with wall collisions
- have a light that lights different areas
- physics of the light ray guided by mirrors
- interaction between player and mirrors
- victory condition





SOUND PART
.wav OK
- sound of footsteps
- sound of wall collision and mirror collision
- sound of moving mirror
- level theme (with subtracks for close ennemy, close light ray, low life...)
- victory theme
